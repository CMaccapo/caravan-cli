# Caravan Rules
## Cards
### Numeric Card
- Ace and 2-9

Function
- They can be added to the end of a caravan if they follow the caravan's direction or suit. 
- They have points equal to their value.  An ace is worth 1 point. 
### Special Card
Function
- Special cards cannot be placed on their own. Special cards attach to played number cards (in either players field). They each function differently.
- Special cards that stay attached stack with each other.

**Jacks** remove the card they are played on.
**Queens** can only attach to the last card in a caravan. They reverse the caravan's direction and change its suit to the queen's suit.
**Kings** double the points of the card they are attached to.
**Jokers** either 
1. Played on 2-9: remove all cards in the field with the same value as the 2-9 card
2. Played on A: remove all cards in the field with the same suit as the A

## Caravans
Each player has 3 caravans consisting of played numeric cards.
### Direction and Suit
Caravans have a direction and a suit.
The suit is the last card's suit.
The direction is ascending if the last two card values are ascending.
The direction is descending if the last two card values are descending.
The direction and suit changes if there is a queen on the last card.

### Points and Selling
The caravan's points is the sum of all its cards points (including King'd values).
A caravan is sellable when its points are between 21 and 26 inclusive.
### Competition
Only one caravan in each opposing column can be selling at once. When both are sellable, the caravan with more points wins. If both are tied, none win.

## Game Structure
### Pregame Setup
Players start with 8 cards.
Players can only place a number card in one of their empty caravans until each caravan has one number card and each player has 5 cards in their hand (3 rounds).
### Main Phase
On their turn, players can do 1:
1. Play a card from their hand
2. Discard a card from their hand
3. Clear one of their caravans
If the action removes a card from the hand, draw a card unless in Pregame Setup. Players should have 5 cards. 

This phase ends when the game is won or when the deck runs out.
### End Game
The game ends when: 
1. The deck runs out (No winner)
2. One of each of the competing caravans is selling
The winner is the owner of the most selling caravans.
